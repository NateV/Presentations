[RevealJS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) together enable an excellent technique for creating and sharing slide-based presentations. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) generates the static web pages and [RevealJS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) turns html into nicely styled slide-based presentations.

This site hosts presentations that I have prepared using these tools.
